## Overview

Bot Flows allow you to create automated response sequences that handle common customer interactions without manual intervention.

## Flow Components

- **Actions** — Responses the bot sends (text, images, quick replies, cards)
- **Conditions** — Logic branches based on user input
- **Delays** — Timed pauses between messages

2. Click "Create Flow"

5. Set up branching conditions
6. Test and activate
