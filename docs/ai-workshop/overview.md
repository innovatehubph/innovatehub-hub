# AI Workshop

The AI Workshop is InnovateHub's most powerful feature — a Claude AI-powered development environment that generates, reviews, and deploys new dashboard features automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Describe** what you want in natural language
2. **AI generates** production-ready React + TypeScript code
3. **Code is staged** on a git branch for review
4. **AI QA reviews** the generated code for quality
5. **One-click deploy** merges and builds to production

## Pipeline

```
Generate -> Stage -> QA Review -> Deploy to Production
```
